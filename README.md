# This is my very first project! A test of skills acquired so far. It is pretty straight forward. You enter data regarding your schedule and it plots you a pie chart back as well as it calculates your projected income per week, month, year. In order to run it in IDE (like pycharm or sublime), you might need to pip install matplotlib and tkinter.
